# Goose Platformer Together

Goose Platformer Together is a modified version of Goose Platformer which adds multiplayer.

# How to host

If you are hosting, you'll need some maps. This version does not include the editor, so you'll need [the original game](https://nibbl-z.itch.io/goose-platformer) to create some. Take the .goose files from the original game's save (AppData > Roaming > goose-platformer) and put them in this version's save (AppData > roaming > goose-platformer-multiplayer). Then you can host a server by clicking the Host button on the main menu, selecting a map, picking a username, and starting the server.

You'll probably need to do some port forwarding thing for other players to join which I don't understand, so what I did to play the game with friends is I simply used [Hamachi](https://vpn.net/)

# How to join

Players will need to put in the server's IP address and a username to join. 

# How to play

It's a platformer! Or a strange social experience! Or a sandbox! It's whatever you want it to be! Have fun!
